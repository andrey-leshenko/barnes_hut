# Barnes-Hut Simulation

An n-body simulation using the [Barnes-Hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation) algorithm.

The generated objects are made to resemble a galaxy, but aren't scientifically [accurate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve).

Code skeleton taken from [here](https://github.com/nikital/pid).
